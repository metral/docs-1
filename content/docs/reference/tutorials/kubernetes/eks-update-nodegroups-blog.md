## Day 2 Kubernetes - Migrating EKS Node Groups with Zero Downtime

Managed Kubernetes clusters greatly reduce the overhead required in
administering Kubernetes. However, the cluster is only one of the
components under management, as app lifecycles and component updates are
self-driven tasks that vary by workloads. In Kubernetes, node groups are a
useful mechanism of creating pools of resources that can enforce
scheduling requirements. They also provide a utility for shifting
workloads around during cluster management and updates.

In this post, we'll see how to use Pulumi for Day 2 Kubernetes administration.
We'll spin up a new EKS cluster with two node groups, and a given workload.
Then we'll add an additional, updated node group, and migrate the workload
over to it with zero downtime using code and `kubectl`.

The complete tutorial, code, and resources for this post are available on [GitHub][eks-nodegroup-tutorial].

## Create an EKS Cluster & Deploy Workloads

The inital update we'll perform will configure and launch an EKS cluster using
`v1.13` of Kubernetes, along with the cluster's infrastructure dependencies
(VPC, IAM, tagging etc.) using [Crosswalk for AWS][crosswalk-aws]. We'll also
create and attach the following node groups to the cluster:

* A Standard `t2.medium` worker node group using the recent `v1.13.7` worker [AMI][eks-amis].
	* For general purpose workloads such as the [`echoserver`][echoserver],
    a simple app that echo's client request headers.
* A `2xlarge` `t3.2xlarge` worker node group using the previous `v1.12.7` worker [AMI][eks-amis].
	* For larger, intensive workloads such as the community [NGINX Ingress Controller][ingress-nginx].

With the cluster successfully created and the node groups available, Pulumi
will deploy our workload: the [`echoserver`][echoserver] and the [NGINX Ingress Controller][ingress-nginx] that will manage it's ingress.
The `echoserver` will land on the Standard node group, and NGINX is set
to specifically target the `2xlarge` node group.

Once the workload is deployed, we can validate it is up and running by accessing
the `echoserver` behind the NGINX endpoint using `curl`:

## The Great Migration

After initial deployment, we decide to update the node group used by NGINX.

We'll move NGINX from the `2xlarge` node group over to a new, `4xlarge` worker
node group that differs in: AMI, instance type, and desired instance count.

Creating the new `4xlarge` node group:

As we migrate NGINX over to the `4xlarge` and decommission the `2xlarge` node
group in the next steps, we'll actively load test the endpoint of the
`echoserver` to ensure that we are not losing requests through out the migration.

### Retargeting NGINX to the `4xlarge` Node Group

With the `4xlarge` node group created, we'll retarget NGINX to the `4xlarge`
group by changing its node selector scheduling terms.
This will cause Kubernetes to perform a rolling update of NGINX.

In order to successfully migrate across node groups, NGINX is configured with HA
settings, spread-type scheduling predicates, and can gracefully terminate
within the Kubernetes [Pod lifecycle][pod-lifecycle].

### Decommissioning the `2xlarge` Node Group

Once migration of NGINX has completed onto the `4xlarge` node group, we can
commence the draining and deletion of the original `2xlarge` node group no
longer in use from Kubernetes and Pulumi.

To drain the `2xlarge` node group, we'll use `kubectl drain`:

```bash
for node in $(kubectl get nodes -l beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=t3.2xlarge -o=name); do
    kubectl drain --force --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data --grace-period=10 "$node";
done
```

Once draining has completed, and we've verified that the worker instances
backing our NGINX service load balancer no longer include the
`2xlarge` group, we can safely delete the nodes from the Kubernetes
API server using `kubectl delete`:

```bash
for node in $(kubectl get nodes -l beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=t3.2xlarge -o=name); do
    kubectl delete "$node";
done
```

Lastly, we can delete the `2xlarge` Auto Scaling Group from Pulumi
and AWS by removing its resource definition from our Pulumi program,
and running `pulumi up`.

### Summary

In this post we stood up an EKS cluster with a couple of node groups, and an
`echoserver` and NGINX workload. We then created a new, updated node group and
migrated NGINX over to it.

We acheived this node group migration with zero downtime to our apps during
load testing and decommissioning of the original node group.
